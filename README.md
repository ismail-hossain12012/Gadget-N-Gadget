## **Test Plan:**

A test plan is a comprehensive document that outlines the scope, objectives, resources, schedule, and approach to be used for testing a software application. It includes details such as test strategy, test scenarios, test cases, entry and exit criteria, roles and responsibilities, and risk management strategies.

## **Bug Reports:**

A bug report is a document that details information about a defect or issue found during testing. It typically includes information such as the description of the bug, steps to reproduce it, severity level, screenshots or videos if applicable, environment details, and any other relevant information to help developers identify and fix the issue.
